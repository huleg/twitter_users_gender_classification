%Testing various weak-learners. -Playground 

% This is an updated version of majority_voting.m, we can incorprate more
% classifiers later. This function is compatible with cross_validation_idx.
% If you create new classifiers, please follow the interface below!


% Inputs: 
%   idx: the indices of the testing set. 
%       Here we assume that we have
%       5000 samples (We manually add 2 samples to the training set, so that the
%       neural network will not run into trouble:)
%   accuracy: the expected accuracy
%   opts: please pass all your options of the classifier here!

% Outputs: 
%   Yhat: The labels predicted, 1 for female, 0 for male, -1 for uncertain.
%       Note that we have -1 because we want to limit the accuracy as we
%       inputed
%   Ytest: The test ground truth labels. 
%   YProb: This is all the *RAW* outputs of the classifiers. n*p matrix, n
%   for number of samples, p for number of classifiers. For a single
%   classifier, p = 1.
